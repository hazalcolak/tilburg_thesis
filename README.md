This file provides the codes for the thesis titled 'School Dropout Prediction in Malawi Using Household Panel Data: Machine Learning Approach', submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Data Science & Society at the Department of Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence, Tilburg University.

This research builds machine learning models to predict school dropout in Malawi using household panel data. The current knowledge embodied in the machine learning literature to predict school dropouts focuses on students’ school grades and attendance patterns as features while not taking into consideration of socioeconomic, parental and community characteristics of children. As an alternative approach, a rich set of variables are obtained from the household data in this analysis and used to build Random Forest, LASSO, Ridge and Multilayer Neural Network models. Also, this study explores how performance metrics differ when we embed the training samples’ weights into the cost function of machine learning models. This study argues that the weighted sample structure of household data and its wide range of variables can enrich the literature in machine learning and yield valuable results to harness the potential of data science for society.
